As a Software Developer with an interest in Data Science, I have been working on existing projects along with driving digital solutions and initiations.
Sustainability being motivation, the projects that we develop are centered towards carbon neutrality. Being a full-stack developer, 
I work with tools like (but not limited to) Node.js, React.js (Redux-Saga),
.NET Core, Postgres, GraphQL, etc. JavaScript, Python, and C# is my strength. In Data Science, apart from optimization,
been developing Machine Learning algorithms to assist in understanding the data which is collected and forecast the key variables for different models.
