As a DevOps and Software Engineer, I'm currently managing our DevOps developments in Innovation and Digital Transformation (IDT) at Ramboll's Environment and Health (E&H). Azure and GCP are the two cloud vendors we use for our digital services. Sustainability being motivation, the projects that we develop are centered toward carbon neutrality. Being a DevOps engineer, I work with tools like (but not limited to) Docker, Terraform, Kubernetes, Argo, AzureDevops, and GitLab, along with developing applications using Node.js, React.js (Redux-Saga), .NET Core, Postgres, GraphQL, etc. JavaScript, Python, and C# are my strengths.
